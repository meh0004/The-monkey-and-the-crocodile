Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who lived on a berry tree, which was on the banks of a river.
In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife... 
One day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered
him some fruits. The crocodile came back the next day for some more fruits, as he loved them.
